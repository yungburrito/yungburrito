I am Yung_Burrito. I am a 17 year old script kiddie with a horrible temper. Sometimes I like making funny little
programs that have no meaningful purpose or use.

I have basic knowledge in Python and C, and have an interest in obfuscuation and OPSEC.

I also know some stuff about the Dark Web, reach out if you need any help! <3
